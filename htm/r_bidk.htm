</pre>
This routine deletes the key/recNo pair.
<p>
This routine is typically used to physically remove a key that was
previously stored into the index file (for transaction rollback).  The
recNo is the data (32-bit value) that is attached to the key and stored
in the index file (typically, this is the record number of the associated
data record in the DBF file).
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp; Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the key is deleted.
