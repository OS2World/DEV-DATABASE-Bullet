<h2>Bullet 3.0 Technical Support</h2>
<br>
<a href="ordering.htm">&lt;&nbsp;Prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="_toc.htm">TOC</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="prolog.htm">Next&nbsp;&gt;</a>
<p>
Technical support is available by e-mail only.  The typical turnaround is within 24 hours,
including weekends.  If you don't receive a response within that time feel free to resend
your letter, as needed.  The e-mail address to initially send your letter is shown below.
<p>
If you need specific help in using Bullet, write a well-detailed letter to the support address
listed below, describing what you want to do, or what you've already done, and what help you
need.  The more specific and detailed you can be the better the help is likely to be.  Guidelines
on what should be included follow.
<p>
<h3>Technical support costs</h3>
<p>
Technical support is available at no charge for the first year of a license, starting from
the purchase date.  This support does not include debugging your code, and does not include
writing code (a separate arrangement for these can be made).
<p>
A one-year paid-support plan is available (either at initial purchase or any time after), which
entitles the licensee to support for one year, starting either from the Bullet purchase date
plus one year (<i>ie</i>, after the intial support period ends), or from the date of the plan's
purchase, whichever is later.  In other words, if you buy the paid-support plan at the same time
you purchases a Bullet license, you have two years of free technical support.  The paid-support
plan's price <i>is</i> subject to change so purchase it with Bullet to lock in at that price.
Support covers all Bullet versions licensed while the plan is active (for example, buy 3.0 and,
later, 3.1: both versions are covered by this single plan).
<p>
<h3>Getting updates, reporting a bug, requesting an enhancement</h3>
<p>
Bug fixes are free for your version.point release when delivered by the internet ($10 US by
diskette) for as long as you have a support plan active (which is always at least one year).
<p>
The history of changes is available at
<a href="http://40th.com/blt3/30/history.html">Bullet 3.0 History of Changes</a>.
<p>
Version.point support will continue as needed.  This means version _30, for example, will
continue to be fixed (as a version _30), as needed, even if later versions have been released:
you don't have to upgrade just to get a fix for an otherwise perfectly working code library.
For submitting bug reports, see below.  For enhancement requests, send the request by e-mail
(one request per letter) to the address below, and you just might see your request in the next
point release.
<p>
Upgrades outside of the purchased version.point release (for example, 3.0 to 3.5) will be
for enhancements-upgrades only.  Discounts apply if you have an active support plan
(<i>ie</i>, during the first year, or with a paid-support plan after that).
<p>
<br>
Bug reports are always no-charge incidents.  However, submitted bug reports can be
investigated only if the following conditions are met:
<ol>
<li>A detailed problem description is needed, including:
 <ol type=A>
 <li>The version of Bullet software being used, and the platform/compiler used
 <li>The exact problem described in detail
 <li>A step-by-step guide to follow in order to recreate the problem
 </ol>
<br>
<li>If source code is needed to recreate the problem (usually the case), it:
 <ol type=A>
 <li>Must be short, and contain no source that is not directly needed to recreate the problem
 <li>Must be in standard C, with no non-standard libraries used (must compile to an EXE)
 <li>Must be Bullet-related
 </ol>
</ol>
Package the report in a .zip archive if needed.  Before sending a report that includes
a zip, contact support first with a brief description of the problem.  You'll be contacted
as soon as possible with instructions.  If no zip is needed, you may mail the report directly
to the e-mail address below.
<p>
<p>
In most cases an answer (or a fix if needed) will be returned within 24 hours, and hopefully
will resolve any problems, but if not feel free to request that the report be left open for
more help.
