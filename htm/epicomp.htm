<h4>Compatibility</h4>
Regarding compatibility with previous versions...there is none.  The
API is totally new, though the functions themselves map nearly 1:1 with
Bullet 2.x.  The index file format is new (IX4).  The main reason for this
is to allow longer key lengths (primarily for dealing with unicode, which
will be better supported in a later release).  If you need to remain
compatible with 1.x or 2.x use those versions.
<p>
The DBF data file format is still same.  However, the DBT format has been
changed with regard to deleted memo records.  In Bullet 2.x, deleted memos
kept their size state -- in other words, if a memo had 400 data bytes
then its size was kept as 408 (8 bytes of overhead; the memo size routine
returned the data bytes' size, or 400).  In Bullet 3, deleted memos have
their size (as stored in the memo file itself) converted to blocks.  So,
that 408-byte memo would have its memo size (again, as stored in the memo
file) set to 1, for one block (block size defaults to 512 bytes).  This
affects deleted memos only.  The optional <code>VALIDATE.EXE</code> program
can be used to convert memo files from Bullet 2.x to Bullet 3 and back (only
needed if there are deleted memos; packing the database to remove deleted
memos is another way).  Be sure to read the Validate documentation before
doing any conversion.
<p>
Multi-threaded access is no longer guarded by Bullet.  Instead, the programmer
is given the task of ensuring that multiple access of a handle pack (TBLT_DH or
TBLT_KH) is serialized.  B2 serialized access to Bullet itself at the process level;
B3 lets the programmer serialize at the handle level, meaning multiple threads
may be inside Bullet at any one time (B2 allowed only one thread per process
in its code at any one at a time).  The TBLT_KH/TBLT_DH structures include a slot,
.mutexHandle, for a semaphore, though Bullet itself does not use it.  The
supplemental documentation covers this more.
<p>
<h4>Support</h4>
Bullet 2.x and Bullet 1.x continue to be supported with bug fixes, as
required.
