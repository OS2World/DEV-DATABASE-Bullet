TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltDataReadHeader(TBLT_DH *dhPtr);


 dhPtr          IO:data file control structure

</pre>
This routine reloads the data file's header info the TBLT_DH structure.
<p>
This routine is automatically called by a full-lock <code>BltLockDataRecord()</code>.
Therefore, this routine should be used only if a full-lock is not done by that method.
<p>
This routine is essential for multi-access use.  It is used in conjunction
with the <code>BltLock*()</code> routines.  <em>After</em> locking the data file a
call to this routine is necessary to ensure that the memory image of the DBF header
is up-to-date with regard to the disk image, since it may have been altered since
last accessed by your code.
<p>
If a memo file is attached, its header is also reloaded.
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the header data is reloaded.
