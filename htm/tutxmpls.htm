<p>
The distribution package has source to several example programs.  These include:
<pre>
  blt3demo.h  The include file for these examples, with the master control #define switch
  addrecs.c   Adds records to data file
  addrix.c    Adds records and reindexes, and gets next/prev
  create.c    Creates data and index files
  crypto.c    A Crypto callback handler example
  geteq.c     Get equal, equal or greater, equal or lesser, key for record
  getfwd.c    Get next
  getrev.c    Get previous
  insrecs.c   Insert records and keys
  liuex.c     Lock, insert, update transaction example
  lock.c      Lock records and keys
  lock_rt.c   Lock records and keys with read-through locks
  memoadd.c   Add a memo record
  memodel.c   Delete a memo record
  memoupd.c   Update a memo record
  open.c      Open data and index files
  updrecs.c   Update records and keys

  dynaload.c  How to use runtime linking, example of getting Bullet version info

</pre>
<p>
These should be built as a project since most use extern calls into at least one other of
these modules.  Each can be compiled to a stand-alone executable by way of a switch (see
the blt3demo.h file), which determines which of the modules will have its main() compiled.
<p>
For a quick check using the Microsoft 32-bit compiler, from the command line enter
<pre>
  cl create.c -D BLT_WIN32 -D TEST_MODULE_CREATE b3w32c30.lib  (b3w32d30.lib for the demo)
</pre>
This builds create.exe.  This module is self-contained so does not need any of the other
source modules.  This file simply creates three, empty files ($DEMO_01.DBF/DBT/IX4).
<p>
If you have a compiler/linker that needs to use an OMF import library, use
<code>b3w32i30.lib</code> (<code>b3w32j30.lib</code> for the demo).  You can also use
run-time linking (see dynaload.c) instead of an import library.
<p>
File dynaload.c is a separate example, and not part of the main example project.  It
can be built very easily.  First, edit it by changing the platform and DLL name, if
needed, then
<pre>
  cl dynaload.c
</pre>
Run dynaload.exe to see the version of Bullet that was used.
<p>
In general, to compile/link, include the correct import library for your compiler (COFF
for Microsoft and most current compilers, OMF for most everybody else) and build away.
Consult your compiler documentation for specifics, or contact Bullet technical support.
<p>
For Windows 32-bit builds, <code>#define BLT_WIN32</code> before including any Bullet header
file.  Use <code>b3w32c30.lib</code> for COFF compiler/linkers (<code>b3w32d30.lib</code> for
the demo), and <code>b3w32i30.lib</code> for OMF compiler/linkers (<code>b3w32j30.lib</code>
for the demo).
<p>
For Windows 16-bit builds, <code>#define BLT_WIN16</code> before including any Bullet header
file.  Use <code>b3w16i30.lib</code> (<code>b3w16j30.lib</code> for the demo).
<p>
For OS/2 32-bit builds, <code>#define BLT_OS232</code> before including any Bullet header
file.  Use <code>b3o32i30.lib</code> (<code>b3o32j30.lib</code> if demo).
<p>
For DOSX32 32-bit builds, <code>#define BLT_DOS32</code> before including any Bullet header
file.  Use <code>b3d32_30.lib</code>.
<p>
For DOS16 16-bit builds, <code>#define BLT_DOS16</code> before including any Bullet header
file.  Use <code>b3d16_30.lib</code>.
<p>
<h4>Program Termination</h4>
<p>
It's recommended that you use a method to close all open files (especially) for abnormal
program endings.  One way to ensure that is to create a routine that knows what files are open
(based on KH/DH data structures) and to close any that are still open when it gains control.
Use <code>atexit()</code> or a similar exception handler mechanism for this (see your compiler
documentation, or better still, system documentation for ExitList support).  All that's needed
is to call <code>BltDataCloseFile/BltIx4CloseFile</code> for those files still open.  It's
recommended that you close index files before closing their respective data files (<em>ie</em>,
close IX4 first, then the DBF).  <b>It is extremely important that all Bullet files be properly
closed before exiting your program</b>.
