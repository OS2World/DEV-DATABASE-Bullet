TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltDataCloseFile(TBLT_DH *dhPtr);


 dhPtr          IO:data file control structure

</pre>
This routine closes a DBF data file that was opened by <code>BltDataOpenFile()</code>,
and if its .memoHandle indicates a memo file, the memo file is also closed.
<p>
Any file that has been written to must be closed by calling this routine
before ending your program.  If the data structure at dhPtr is no longer
required, you should release the memory after a successful close.
<p>
This routine should be called for every open file handle opened by
<code>BltDataOpenFile()</code> regardless of exit conditions.  It's recommened
that an exit handler be installed and for it to verify that all handles opened
are closed before exiting your program.
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the file's DBF (and DBT) header was
updated and the handle closed.
