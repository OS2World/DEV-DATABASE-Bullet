TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltDataCopyHeader(TBLT_DH *dhPtr,

 dhPtr          I:data file control structure
 filenamePtr    I:name of new DBF file

</pre>
This routine copies the structure of the dhPtr's DBF file to a new file
named in filenamePtr.
<p>
The new file is created by this routine and its structure is a clone of the
passed TBLT_DH structure.  The new file will have -0- records, but otherwise is
identical to TBLT_DH.  The TBLT_DH file is not affected.
<p>
If the TBLT_DH file has a memo file attached, the new file will also have an
empty memo file created.
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise a new file is created, including
memo file if required.
