TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltLockDataHeader(TBLT_DH *dhPtr,
                                       ULONG mode,
                                       ULONG timeout);


 dhPtr          I:data file control structure
 mode           I:lock type
 timeout        I:timeout, in milliseconds

</pre>
This routine locks the data file's header.
<p>
The mode can be a combination of the following:
<pre>
 LOCK_MODE_EXCLUSIVE or LOCK_MODE_SHARED
 LOCK_MODE_SH2EX or LOCK_MODE_EX2SH
 LOCK_MODE_ATOMIC
</pre>
Atomic locks are only available on 32-bit OS/2.  Shared locks (and the
<code>SH2EX</code> and <code>EX2SH</code>) are only available on 32-bit
OS/2 and WinNT.  A shared lock is a read-only lock, where any process
may read the file, but no process may write to it.
<p>
If the lock cannot be made before the timeout period ends the error
<code>EXB_TIMEOUT</code> is returned.
<p>
At data file open, the open mode could have the flag,
<pre>
 FLAGS_READ_THROUGH_LOCK_BIT
</pre>
specified.  This is similar to a shared lock, in that any process
may read the locked region by simply not attempting to lock the region before
reading it.  However, there is no write protection unless the programmer
attempts to lock the locked region before writing to it.  The optional
lockix4.c and lockdata.c files cover this technique.  If you always attempt
to lock the header before writing, you can ensure that only one write
access is made at a time.  You must always follow up with a flush and
unlock.
<p>
After locking, and before making any access to the data file, you must call
<code>BltDataReadHeader()</code> to load the data file header from disk into
TBLT_DH.  It's recommended that if <code>FLAGS_READ_THROUGH_LOCK_BIT</code> is
set that you not write to the data file since the structure (the number of
records) of the data file may change out-from-under other processes accessing
this file at the same time.
<p>
<em>Returns:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the data file
header is locked.
