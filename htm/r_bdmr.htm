TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltDataMarkRecord(TBLT_DH *dhPtr,
                                       ULONG recNo,
                                       ULONG tagChar);


 dhPtr          IO:data file control structure
 recNo          I:number of record to remove
 tagChar        I:byte to set tag character

</pre>
This routine marks a data record's tag byte (the first byte of the record)
with the tagChar byte.
<p>
Data records are not physically removed when deleted.  Instead, records are
tagged, or marked, as being deleted and then later removed by using
<code>BltDataPack()</code>.  The first byte of each data record is reserved for
this byte.  (Your first field starts at the second byte of the data record.)
<p>
The standard markers for this are &lt;space&gt; (a blank, ASCII 32) and <code>*</code> (a
star, ASCII 42).  The space indicates that the record is not deleted, and a
star indicates that the record is deleted (marked as deleted, that is).
<p>
Two C macros are included if explicit delete and undelete names are needed.
Supply the dhPtr and recNo args, leaving the tagChar to be set by the
macro.
<pre>
 #define BltDataDeleteRecord(a,b)    BltDataMarkRecord(a,b,42)
 #define BltDataUndeleteRecord(a,b)  BltDataMarkRecord(a,b,32)
</pre>
Since your program has control of the entire data record already, this
routine is not necessary; you may just set the first byte of your record as
you want.  However, you must still reserve this first byte for this use.
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the first byte of the record is set
to tagChar.
