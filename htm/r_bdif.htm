TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltDataInfoFile(TBLT_FNCHAR *filenamePtr,
                                     ULONG asMode,
                                     TBLT_DBFINFO *dbfInfoPtr,
                                     ULONG *noFieldsPtr,
                                     TBLT_AUXPACK *apPtr);


 filenamePtr    I:name of the file to get info on
 asMode         I:access-sharing mode used for the temporary open
 dbfInfoPtr     O:structure to store the DBF info
 noFieldsPtr    O:variable to store the number of fields in the DBF
 apPtr          I:auxiliary pack

</pre>
This routine should be called before opening a DBF where its structure is not known,
especially to get the number of fields so that a TBLT_DH structure of correct size
can be allocated for the actual open.
<p>
<code>asMode</code> is the access-sharing mode to open the file.  See
<code>BltDataOpenFile()</code> for modes available.  The file is closed
before this routine exits.
<p>
TBLT_DBFINFO is the same structure as the first 32 bytes of the TBLT_DH structure
starting from fileID.  The number-of-fields data is used to determine what
size the TBLT_DH allocation must be to hold both the TBLT_DH structure, which
includes the first 32 bytes of the DBF file, and to hold all the 32-byte field
descriptors (there is one field descriptor for each field in the DBF).  The
total allocation size for TBLT_DH, required prior to calling <code>BltDataOpenFile()</code>, is
<p>
<pre>
 sizeof(TBLT_DH) + ((noFields-1) * 32)
</pre>
<p>
<code>apPtr</code> is the pointer to an optional auxiliary pack.  Set apPtr = 0 if there
is no pack.  This pack lets you override the internal operating system IFS calls for this
handle, and set IFS options, such as 64-bit file offsets.  See the supplemental
documentation for details.  Once opened, apPtr is set in the TBLT_KH structure.
<p>
<em>Returns:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the structure at dbfInfoPtr receives
the DBF header, and noFieldsPtr is set to the number of fields.
