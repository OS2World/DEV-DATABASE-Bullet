Bullet 3.0

__htm.txt

This is the Bullet 3.0 online documentation.  This is the complete documentation
as of the date above.

An HTML 3.2 compatible reader is needed.

To start it up, the following can be used:

 netscape.exe file:///_toc.htm

or as your browser/reader requires to load a file.htm.

_toc.htm is the Table of contents page, from where you can easily navigate
the documentation.  A few, select pages will link to the URL

 http://40th.com/(some URL)

so you will have to be online to read those (like the history.html and
orderform.html pages).
