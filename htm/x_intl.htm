The DBF file format specifies that all data within it is to be in OEM character codes.  Ideally,
this would be the printable character set between 32 and 127.  A further restriction is placed
on field names:  they may include the characters from A to Z (uppercase), and the _.  Bullet
itself has no such restrictions.
<p>
Nevertheless, you should be aware of how different character sets may affect your data, and
how Bullet operates on that data.  One immediate concern is the difference between OEM (ASCII)
data and Windows (pseudo-ANSI) data, and how they are mapped in any conversion process.  For
example, the character in one codepage may map to a different character in another codepage.
This can go so far as to prevent a filename from being recognized between machines (or even
different codepages on the same machine).
<p>
When you create an index file, Bullet allows you to specify the international codepage to use.
With this, Bullet gets from the operating system the sort table it uses to order key data.
Alternatively, you may specify the sort table data directly if you have special needs, such
as the case where the operating system doesn't have the sort table you need to use.
<p>
If Bullet cannot get the sort table from the operating system (and no sort table is otherwise
specified), it will use instead one of two internal sort tables: codepage 850 (multi-lingual,
ASCII) or codepage 1252 (Windows, Ansi).  It determines which of these to use based on a flag
specified for BltIx4CreateFile():  if you specify <code>SORT_USE_ANSI_SET</code> in sortCmpCode,
Bullet will use the cp1252 table, otherwise the cp850 table.  This sort table is stored in each
index file (see KH.sortTable[]).
<p>
Yet another possibilty is to replace the Bullet index-support routines.  For example, if you
need to use unicode data in records (or any double-byte character set) you need to replace
Bullet's routines that construct and compare keys.  If you also need to use unicode field names,
then you'll also need to replace the routine that parses the text-based key expression (though
that can be worked around).  Information on replacing the index-support routines is covered
elsewhere in this supplement.
