<p>
The PET database is to provide:
<ol>
<li>A way to store problem reports
<li>A way to store ehancement requests
<li>A way to search, update, and review problem reports
<li>A way to search, update, and review enhancement requests
</ol>
<p>
Problem reports are entered from the keyboard into a dialog with specific entry fields
such as product ID (including version), customer ID, and so on.
<p>
The database can be searched by product or by customer (restricted to just these two
for simplicity in this tutorial), so that all problems for a given product ID can be
viewed, or all problem/enhancement reports by a given customer can be viewed.
