TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltUnlockDataRecord(TBLT_DH *dhPtr,
                                         ULONG recNoStart,
                                         ULONG recCount);


 dhPtr          I:data file control structure
 recNoStart     I:record number to start unlock at
 recCount       I:number of records to unlock from recNoStart

</pre>
This routine unlocks the data file, either all or selected records.
<p>
To unlock the entire data file, including the header, set recNoStart = 0
(recCount is not used when recNoStart = 0).  Doing this automatically calls
<code>BltDataFlushHeader()</code> if this is the last outstanding full lock
(otherwise the full lock count is simple decremented one for this TBLT_DH).
You can only unlock a full-lock if there is an outstanding full-lock; you cannot
use this to unlock records that have been locked individually.
<p>
To unlock a particular record, or series of records, set recNoStart to the
first record to unlock and recCount to the number of records to unlock, starting
at recNoStart.  The first record is record number 1.  This unlock must exactly
match a previous <code>BltLockDataRecord</code> for recNoStart and count.
<p>
As stated above, the unlock must exactly match its respective lock with regard
to recNoStart and recCount.
<p>
<em>Returns:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the select
record(s), or the entire file, is unlocked.
