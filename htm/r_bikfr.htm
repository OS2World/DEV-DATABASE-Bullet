 khPtr          I:index file control structure

 recordPtr      I:data record whose key is being sought

</pre>
This routine returns the key used by the recordPtr/recNo pair.
<p>
This routine is typically used to determine the key that was stored in the index file
for this record/recNo pair so that it may be deleted (for transaction rollback).
<p>
The recordPtr must already contain the data record, and recNo its record number.
<p>
If recNo is set to 0 on entry the index file is not searched for the key.  Instead, this routine
returns the key that this record would have if it were in the index file.  This is useful to
generate multi-part keys for lookups using BltIx4GetEqual(), for example (in 3.00.08+).
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Returns Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the key is in keyBufferPtr.
