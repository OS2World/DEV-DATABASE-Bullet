 khPtr          I:index file control structure
 workFilePtr    I:pathname of temporary file to create
 nodePackPct    I:node pack percentage, 50 to 100

 recNoPtr       O:recNo at time of error (<i>eg</i>, recNo of duplicate record)

This routine reindexes the open index file.
<p>
The workFilePtr is to be a unique filename, and must not already exist.  The
nodePackPct is the percentage that nodes are to be packed.  The default
(when packPct is 0) is 100% (as many keys as possible are placed on a
node).  If there is an error, keyPtr and recNoPtr will have the values at
the time of the error.  This is useful for locating duplicate records, for
example.
<p>
TBLT_KH.xCallBackPtr may have a pointer to a callback function that is called
periodically by the reindex routine, otherwise, if 0, no callback is made.
<p>
To exclude certain records, such as deleted records, or to include only certain records in
the index, see <a href="r_bii.htm"><code>BltIx4Insert()</code></a>.
<p>
See the supplemental documentation for more on tuning this routine.
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the index file is reindexed.
