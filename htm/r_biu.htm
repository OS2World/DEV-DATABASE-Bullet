TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltIx4Update(TBLT_KH *khPtr,
                                  VOID *keyBufferPtr,
                                  ULONG recNo,
                                  VOID *newRecPtr,
                                  ULONG *actionPtr);


 khPtr          I:index file control structure
 keyBufferPtr   O:new key stored (if different)
 recNo          I:recNo of record to update
 recordPtr      I:updated record data
 actionPtr      O:action taken

</pre>
This routine updates (if needed) the data record identified by recNo, builds a
key for it (if needed), and stores that key and recNo into the index file (if
needed) (not physically in that order).
<p>
A single index file and a single data file are accessed.  To perform more
complex updates see <code>BltIx4UpdateEx()</code>.
<p>
After a successful update, where the key has changed (action=3), the index
position is set to the new key.  <code>FLAGS_ATOMIC_BIT</code> can be set to
restart at the previous, or any, position (see <code>BltIx4GetNext()</code>).
<p>
If the key store operation failed, for whatever reason, the data record
update operation that preceded it will be backed out automatically,
thereby restoring the database to its original state.
<p>
ActionPtr is set to one of the following values:
<pre>
  0 = nothing done (error encountered)
  1 = updated data record only (key did not change)
  3 = updated index and updated data record (key changed)
 16 = could not store new key (reindex required)
 17 = record update failed (data is unchanged)
      and could not restore original key (reindex required)
</pre>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the data record
located at the record number is updated if required and its key updated if required.
