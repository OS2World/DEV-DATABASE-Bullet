TBLT_RETC TBLT_ENTRY BltIx4InfoFile(TBLT_FNCHAR *filenamePtr,
                                    ULONG asMode,
                                    TBLT_IX4INFO *ix4InfoPtr,
                                    TBLT_AUXPACK *apPtr);


 filenamePtr    I:name of file to get info on
 asMode         I:access-share mode used for temporary open
 ix4InfoPtr     I:structure to store the IX4 info
 apPtr          I:auxiliary pack

</pre>
This routine should be called before opening an unknown IX4 file (where its
node size is not known), especially to get the node size used so that a
TBLT_KH structure of correct size can be allocated for the actual open.
<p>
<code>asMode</code> is the access-sharing mode to open the file.  See
<code>BltDataOpenFile()</code> for modes available.  The file is closed
before this routine exits.
<p>
TBLT_IX4INFO is the same structure as the first 44 bytes of the TBLT_KH structure
starting from fileID.  TBLT_IX4INFO.nodeSize is used to determine what size
the TBLT_KH allocation must be to hold both the TBLT_KH structure and the node
buffer.  The TBLT_KH structure includes allocation for a 512-byte buffer (the
typical node size).  The total allocation size for TBLT_KH, then, required prior
to calling BltIx4OpenFile(), is
<p>
<pre>
 sizeof(TBLT_KH) + (nodeSize-512)
</pre>
<p>
<code>apPtr</code> is the pointer to an optional auxiliary pack.  Set apPtr = 0 if there
is no pack.  This pack lets you override the internal operating system IFS calls for this
handle, and set IFS options, such as 64-bit file offsets.  See the supplemental
documentation for details.  Once opened, apPtr is set in the TBLT_KH structure.
<em>Returns:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the structure at ix4InfoPtr receives
the first 44 bytes of the IX4 header on disk.
