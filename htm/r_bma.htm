This routine writes new memo data to the memo file, returning the number
of the first memo block used to store the data.  This number is to be
converted by you to ASCII text ('0000000001', no zero terminator) and
stored in the DBF record, in the appropriate memo field, as the memo number.
<p>
This routine does the initial write of a new memo.  Since a memo in Bullet
can be any size, you can specify an initial size larger than the bytes you
are writing.  This way, you can easily write a single 500KB data in chunks
of, say, 8KB, without unncessarily fragmenting the memo file with updates.
To do this you use this routine to size the memo to the expected size (this
expected size is the size this memo is set to), then write any number of bytes
to start (or even no bytes this time), and then follow-up with a
<code>BltMemoUpdate()</code> for as many times as needed until the entire data
has been written to the memo file.  The programmer must keep track of where in
the memo the last write was when this technique is used, and to program
<code>BltMemoUpdate()</code>'s start offset accordingly.
<p>
If the memo data to write does not need to be written in smaller chunks,
set bytesToSize equal to bytesToWrite.
<p>
<em>Return:</em>&nbsp;Non-zero indicates an error, otherwise the memo has been added.
